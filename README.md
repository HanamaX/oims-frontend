## Volunteer UI Design Changes

The volunteer UI components have been redesigned to provide a more balanced and visually appealing interface while maintaining the system's identity. Key improvements include:

### Color Scheme
- Reduced overwhelming green theme
- Used a balanced palette of emerald and teal shades
- Applied subtle gradients for depth
- Improved text contrast for better readability

### Visual Elements
- Added colored icon circles for better information organization
- Implemented consistent status indicators with meaningful color coding
- Improved card designs with subtle shadows and hover effects
- Added subtle animations for interactive elements

### Components Updated
- volunteer-card-new.tsx
- volunteer-card.tsx
- themed-components.tsx (StatusBadge)
- volunteer/register/page.tsx
- volunteer/info/page.tsx

### Animation & Interactions
- Hover lift effects on cards
- Scale transitions on interactive elements
- Smooth color transitions
- Enhanced button states

These changes create a more professional, cohesive design system for the volunteer-related UI components while maintaining visual consistency with the rest of the application.
